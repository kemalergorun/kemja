Create a program to manage different types of employees
(full-time, part-time, manager, intern, and contract employees).
Each employee type has specific attributes and salary calculation rules.
 The system should be able to calculate the total salary for each employee
 based on their role and conditions.


Conditions:

1. The system must validate employee data (name, ID, salary)
to ensure they are valid.
    If any invalid data is entered (e.g., negative salary),
    the system should provide an error message: "Invalid data entered!".
2. The system should allow calculating and displaying
 the total salary for each employee type.
