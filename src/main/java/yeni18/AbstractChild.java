/*
Practical Example:
In software development, an abstraction can be used in a payment system.
Imagine an online store that accepts different payment methods
like credit cards, PayPal, and Apple Pay.
The store only cares about initiating a payment
but doesnâ€™t need to know how each method processes the payment
behind the scenes. By abstracting the payment system,
the code is simplified: the store only needs to call the makePayment()
method without worrying about the
specific details of each payment method.
This way, new payment methods can be added easily
 without affecting the core store functionality.
