exception: "unexpected problems‚Äù that disrupt the flow of code execution when the code is run.
        Each exception contains an error message and information about the type of error.
        1- Exceptions are errors that disrupt the normal flow of code execution.
        2- An exception is a class. It has methods. It contains error codes, information messages, etc.
        For example; when a method in a class is called, the code starts running. From this moment, the code lines
        start to be read. And if there is an error in the code, an exception situation occurs.
        Of course, developers should foresee these errors beforehand and handle or correct them, but unforeseen situations
        can always occur while the user is using our program. When an error occurs, it is necessary to find out why it
        happened and solve it, or if it cannot be solved at the moment, to produce alternative solutions to ensure the
        system continues to work.
        3- When an exception occurs, code execution stops. Exceptions log sessions in debugging logs.
        4- Exception Handling in Java is a method that allows us to process undesired exceptions or problems in our code
        without interrupting the flow.
        5- When you think of Exception, three things should come to mind: try, catch, and finally (optional).
        6- Even when the code does not run successfully, wrapping all executions in a try-catch statement is considered
        best practice in the programming world to ensure a smooth user experience.
        However, blindly wrapping all code in try-catch blocks is not always the best practice.
        This can mask errors and lead to the program hiding real issues.

        Interview question
            What are the differences between throw and throws?
            1) "throw" is used within the method body, whereas "throws" is used in method signature.
            2) throw can be written and used wherever desired within the method body, as many times as needed.
               throws is written immediately after the method signature and only once.
            3) After "throw", the "new" keyword and a "constructor" are used to create an object.
               After "throws", only the ""Exception class" name is written.
            4) throw is used to throw an Exception under certain conditions (we set a condition that age cannot be negative),
               while throws is used to indicate that a method can throw a certain Exception
               (written in anticipation of a possible error).
